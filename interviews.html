          <p>We interviewed Chinese-American immigrant parents and their young-adult children, ages 18-20, who had been born in the US or immigrated at a young age. We asked <i><u>parents</u></i> what they realistically expected, ideally hoped, and feared <i>for their <u>children’s</u> futures</i> in 5 years and in 20 years. We asked their <i><u>children</u></i> what they realistically expected, ideally hoped, and feared <i>for their <u>own</u> futures</i> in 5 and 20 years.</p>
        <p>To explore their answers to these questions, you can view their transcripts below. The filters can help you narrow down the set of answers you view, according to generation (parent/child), type of future (expected/ideal/feared), and time frame (5 years/20 years). In each category, a maximum of one filter at a time can be selected. </p>
        <p>Please note that transcripts have been lightly edited for clarity, concision, and anonymity. Many of the parent interviews were originally conducted in Mandarin, then translated to English. A Chinese version of all content on this website is in progress – stay tuned! </p>

            Response #1: I just graduated from high school. I'm going to be attending college and studying chemistry. I intend to pursue a pre-med route, so if I excel on that route, then hopefully in five years, I'll be in a med school working on my MD. But I'll be more realistic. I know that it might not be possible, or it might be really hard, or I might burn out, or there might be some reason that I might not make it. I think I'm a very malleable person, so I can see myself going into a lot of different areas. I can see myself going into politics. I can see myself going into education. I just don't know yet. But at the moment, I would like to pursue something in the medical field.

            Response #2: In terms of educational things like career goals, probably one of the most realistic and safest paths for me is to go into law. So that would mean going the pre-professional route throughout college and then going to law school afterwards, and eventually finding a job in industry. In terms of socializing, I’d probably like having some friends in college, and also later on maybe having some dating experiences. I mean, in four or five years, I’m probably not anything really further than that -– having some close friends, including my friends back home from high school,  staying close with my parents and my sister, and probably having some dating experiences, perhaps at that point having a boyfriend, a pretty committed relationship. I think maintaining good relationships with other people is really important. I think that is probably more important than career, although right now, from my point of view because I'm just about to enter college, most of the things I'm thinking about are where my career could go or where my education could go. So that's also really important.

            Response #3: In four to five years. I'll most likely be in graduate school or the end of college. I think that I'll be continuing to study psychology. Since I'm going to XX College and it's known for helping more shy and timid women open up, I think I'll definitely be more outgoing and confident after the four years. I won't be afraid to raise my hand in class or speak what I think about topics that I usually don't speak out about – just not afraid to talk in general, because right now, I'm still kind of trapped in the traditional Chinese way: if required, then you're a good obedient girl, and you'll get rewarded for not getting into trouble. In general, if I'm not sure that what I have to say is completely correct, I won't say it. You can go, "There's really no right or wrong opinions," but I'm just always too afraid to speak.

            Response #4: So after college, I anticipate being on the lookout for an occupation. Not exactly sure what that is yet, but probably somewhere in the STEM field. I'd also probably be trying to connect with people that I had internships with, or reach out to people I met during my time in college. I've actually done a lot of reflection recently on who I want to be and how I want to be in the future. And one of the most pressing things that I wanted to do is be more happy and more content with myself and find something that fulfills me. I'm not exactly sure what that means yet, but I hope to find that through college. It doesn't have to mean being able to find a job with a lot of money or something like that. It just means doing something that I find fulfilling and that makes me content.

I also have the option to pursue graduate school, but that's pretty far away.

            Response #7: Once I graduate, I anticipate myself staying in California, and if I'm not staying in California, I think I'll be in Washington, DC. The reason I say that is because very recently, my career trajectory has turned towards community organizing, governance, politics and policy, helping young people and progressives have more of a voice in the political system. I anticipate myself either working in the California state government or in the federal government in DC. I won't be at home with my family. My sister's in DC, so maybe I'll be near her. I hope to be developing my musicianship. I hope to be continuing to dance and create dance with friends. I hope to still be having romantic experiences, because that's always fun. I hope to have a better connection with my heritage in China, my family in China. I hope I will have a relationship with my grandmother. I feel like being at college, it is very difficult to think outside the possible self of career trajectory. It's like that's always the self that everybody is prioritizing. It's difficult to think about other things.

            Response #8: In four or five years, I see myself graduating from college with a degree in international relations, most likely. I think that's probably the most realistic and most immediate future self I can think of. In terms of personal development, becoming more confident in myself is another future characteristic that I see. Being in college for my first year has exposed me to a lot of — I wouldn't say shortcomings — but definitely parts of myself that I can improve. And I would like to see my future self have more of the qualities that I realize I don't really have, such as confidence in self and compassion for others, more empathy, more willingness to forgive. I know that involves a deconstruction of past selves. I also see myself doing more writing, and I think that's basically it. Right now with coronavirus, it's kind of hard to see directly four or five years into the future. But I'd say maybe for the more immediate future, just finishing certain pieces of writing and being confident in those pieces of writing.

            Response #9: I'll probably be preparing to go to grad school or doing some sort of internship. I see myself somewhere in a big city. If it's not Chicago, then probably somewhere like New York or on the East Coast. And I would be excited. I'd be happy. Four or five years later, I think I may be living off campus, so I'd have my own apartment. Whenever I think of my possible self four or five years in the future, or anytime in the future, I kind of see myself walking down a street or walking to class or something like that, kind of the boring parts of life. I see myself very much more confident than I am now and a lot more happy. Just feeling good.

            Response #10: So in four to five years, I would have graduated college, and I think by then, I would have landed a job. I plan to study economics and international relations. I plan to work somewhere in the financial sector. I believe I'll have a job, and hopefully my own place. Part of my plan is to study abroad in London. I hope to eventually live in another country, maybe not immediately after college, but sometime later, I plan to move away from this country. I hope — I mean, I'm going to settle down with someone. I think that's also part of the future.

I think that was one of my dreams since I was really little, just to be able to be in New York. But I feel like as I grow up, I more want to stay in California. So just taking the four years of college to kind of explore new cities that I once wanted to live in, but not having to have long term commitments.

I'm going to be majoring in econ admin studies. I don't know if I'm going to stick with it.

            Response #16: I'll probably be done with college after four years of undergrad, so I assume I would be either looking for research opportunities as a graduate student, or I would be hitting the job market, putting all the connections that I made in college to good use, and just kind of exploring a lot of new future opportunities. Transitioning from high school to college was a chance to take a look at all the opportunities that were available. Leaving college is going to be a new kind of threshold crossed into an area with an even wider range of possibilities, so I feel like it would be very similar to the transition from high school to college. It would just feel a little uncertain, a little scary, but also a lot of anticipation for what's to come. A lot of people talk about how important it is to network and to form connections with your peers and professors, so that you have a network of people you can rely on. Sometimes I'm worried about whether or not I will be able to form this kind of network, because I'm not very outgoing. I'm pretty introverted, so that's something I worry about. Because a lot of studies are more advanced in college, it might give me a chance to see if I really enjoy learning about a specific field or specific area of study at an advanced level. At an advanced level, it can be harder to understand, but if I can still remain interested, then it will tell me that this is something I could definitely think about doing in the future.

            Response #17: I think very possibly, I will be graduating from college and then hopefully working at a full time job. I don't see it as being a dream job, per se. I can see it as being more like working towards a long-term future that is more of a dream job. But I can see in the next four to five years, working a job that makes me comfortable and is something that I'm relatively excited about — maybe not the thing that I'm the most passionate about in the world. I'm interested in business within tech right now. Specifically, I think in four to five years, or maybe 10 years or so from now, I would love to be a product manager or anything related to that field. But then hopefully in the future, I actually have this silly sort of dream job of becoming an AP US history teacher. I think that's something that I would be comfortable pursuing maybe later down the road. Becoming a teacher is something that I've always wanted to do, but I don't think that's in my near future. And then I also see myself potentially moving back to where I've grown up, but staying away from my family's home if that's possible. And then, just living my 20s and having a good time with friends.

            Response #1: In terms of her future, I actually don't have too many plans. Maybe people won't believe that because they think Chinese parents all plan a lot for their children, but I actually haven't planned too much for her, because I want to give her space to let her explore on her own. I've always told her, you need to have your own dream; I'm just here to help you achieve your dreams. But in the process of helping her, I am rather strict. I tell her, even though she changes — she sometimes says she wants to be a scientist, she sometimes says she wants to be a lawyer, and wants to help her elders, et cetera — I tell her, since you have such big dreams, you best have a high starting point. Go to a relatively good school which will improve your career outlook. Then I say, since you have these standards, you have to hold yourself to these very high expectations. For example, we talk about the public high school she attended. Each grade level had several hundred people, and maybe only a few go to an Ivy-level college, so you have to be in the top 1%. So I do tell her about these things; it does seem like I'm giving her some pressure. But then, when we talk about what happens after she goes to college, we've had some discussions, but not many, and not that specifically. I think that when she was choosing colleges, a main reason she chose XX University was because she felt like XX was more balanced, as in there were more choices and she could explore more things. So, her dad and I are supportive. We just say that since she got into XX and has such a broad world, so many accomplished professors and classmates, we think we should just let her explore. She has always said that after her four years at college she will go to grad school no matter what, but we tell her, you don't have to get a PhD. You can go to law school, business school, even medical school. Heaven knows, in college you might meet friends who want to study medicine, and you might think that's pretty cool and want to learn it too. It's all possible. You might also take two years to work after your bachelor's, and then come back to complete graduate school when you feel more motivated. So we really aren't thinking of anything specific, and we don't place any assignments or wishes onto her. I just mostly want her to keep motivated. I trust that in college, she'll be motivated by the people around her, and then later she'll find a path that's suitable for herself.

            Response #2: I think she will attend graduate school. Right now, she might be interested in psychology, but I am encouraging her to learn some more data science. The reason is because I think, for any subject, no matter if it's psychology or finance or business, it's all about big data. To have meaningful conclusions, you need data science. This is what I have designed for her. Whether she agrees, I don't know. I just hope she has some more tools in her toolbox. I'm just giving her some guidance from my experiences. It's very realistic, right? I think almost all Chinese parents are very practical. You need to have inspiration and aspiration, but you have to have a practical side because you need to make a living as well, right? So for her, I hope she can enjoy the subject, as well as have a tangible, good skill in order to survive in society. I hope she finds a boyfriend, but I won't force it. This is going with the natural flow. If there can be someone rather good, she needs some relationship experience. She was always a very obedient girl. A lot of kids who grew up in America already have boyfriends in high school. I trust that she hasn't yet had this experience, so I hope she can experience it. Relationships are based on compromise. She needs to know that being one person and being two people are completely different things. So I hope she has experience on those fronts.

            Response #3: I think some of his attainable possibilities are that he has a better understanding of the direction of his passion, a better understanding of the trajectory of his major and his interests. Of course, these things might still change along with age and era, but as he first experiences becoming an 18-year-old adult, these choices are, "What am I going to learn? What is going to be my major?" This is the first thing he has to do in college. I'm also very happy to see him exploring on his own, like a child learning to swim. He's choosing among a lot of fields. I think that within these four years, he will have a pretty clear idea of an initial major selection. His life will have lots and lots of interesting things happening. The first is obviously that he will leave home for four years, this loving family, and looking back he'll see people helping him weather the wind and rain. When he himself enters the real world, he'll face hardships, and frustrations. I think frustrations are a very important source of learning in our lives. We cannot avoid them. I think that when you are young, experiencing some frustration is very valuable, but I hope he has the courage and wisdom to face these frustrations. This is why I say he needs to be healthy in the body and heart. Another big thing is romantic relationships. He is a young person, and slowly will learn to love. Maybe as an Asian family, I might think less about this. My thoughts and his dad's thoughts are actually very simple. We don't mind if our child decides to be single, or if he finds out that opposite-sex relationships aren't fitting. I think that's very good if he's happy with it. Perhaps he says, “I like people of the same sex.” I also think that's very good. As long as he thinks, "That's true love," then we love who you are, not who we want you to be. Maybe in this process of self-discovery, he will feel a lot of frustration. But as a parent I will tell him, "Throughout the years, regardless of what happens, if you need Dad and Mom by your side, we will be good listeners. We will be your support. In this world, we won't use any judgmental perspectives to judge you, because that's your life." Another point is that I think he might still be on campus after five years, because he really enjoys studying. I even think there's a possibility that he might just stay at the university and study until at last he's a professor. It's all possible, because I think he's someone who really enjoys that kind of environment. But he also has a very adventurous mindset. I think he has a very strong attraction toward money. He's not satisfied with just having a stable job, but he knows that a stable job is a foundation. Another thing is, after he walks into society, he will see a lot of social levels. Eventually, he will have his own social circle and social standing. I think that in four to six years, I can see something rather exciting for him, including painful and happy moments, but it will be four to six years full of growth.

Of course, during this process, he might have some other changes. For example, if he wants to pause school for a year in the middle for special circumstances, for example entrepreneurship or going to study abroad in another country, I would wholly support.

I support him to pursue what he likes, what he is good at, but I want him to have another set of skills to live better. Both my husband and I are software engineers, but I know my son doesn't like computer science or anything, so we are looking for what kinds of opportunities the college provides. We had a talk. When he applied to college, he put down his major as global liberal studies, so we actually sat down and looked at all the majors each college has, and analyzed the future of each one. He agreed that a double major is a good idea, economics or business maybe, so he can have more choices, as I said. I know he has a girlfriend, it's not like when I was his age — both my husband and I are from China. At the time we were in high school, it wasn't allowed to have a girlfriend or boyfriend. But now, I don't have a problem with it at all. I still do not think that will be a long relationship, since he is still quite young, and also they are going to different colleges. I don't expect they will be together for the rest of their lives, but I do support him to enjoy the relationship and have a girlfriend, especially in this pandemic situation. I think having someone to communicate with, to support each other, and to love each other is a good thing. I think it's normal for teenagers, that kind of relationship.

            Response #2: I think 20 years in the future, social life will be more dominant, or family life. Hopefully by then I'll get married, have kids, still maintain good relationships with friends and colleagues and family, like my parents and sister and her family. Hopefully I have a stable job, probably in law or in the STEM industry.

            Response #3: In 20 years, I'll most likely have a job. I kind of aspire to be a psychiatrist, but that's only because I don't really know too much about job opportunities or career options in the psychology field. I don't really see myself staying in California for 20 years. Maybe I'll come back here after I live in other places, but in 20 years I don't think I'll be in California, maybe in other parts of America. Maybe on the East Coast, Boston or New York.

            Response #5: I think I am going to be a software or user interface designer at some big software company. I'm probably going to have started a family, and I'm probably going to be sad that I've lost a family member or two. I feel like I'm going to be a little bit sad that I've moved away from the good times of my childhood and my time in college. I think the biggest thing as I grow up is that I'm getting a lot more responsibilities to take care of, and right now, I'm only starting to get used to them and I think it'll be a pretty big change. And also, spending time with family members is one big thing that I'm moving away from. I'm kind of bummed out by that. Even now, I'm not even spending that much time with my family members, and I always wish I could, but I'm just not sure what I would do with them. I spend a lot more time with friends than I do with family. But if I didn't start a family at that point, I think the feelings would be much more amplified compared to if I did start a family.

            Response #7: In 20 years, I will be about 40 years old. Wow. I can't predict if I'll have kids or not. I like kids. They might be adopted. It really depends on who I'm with and how busy I am with other parts of my life. I anticipate staying in California, or at least having California as my home for my whole life, but I have thought about going abroad and living there for a while, even though that kind of conflicts with wanting to be in governance and politics. I have thought about living in Japan for a long time, which is funny because I've never actually been to Japan. I have kind of an obsession with the lack of light pollution, like an obsession with darkness, a little bit, and I want to live in a place where I can go outside and see many stars every night, a place where the ocean is clear. And I think that's something that we don't have in California. We don't have clear water and we don't have, for a lot of California, starry skies. I don't think I could live in China for an extended period of time, just because of their political atmosphere. I used to have a fantasy of going and dancing in Europe, because they support dancers more there, they support the arts more, but that fantasy is kind of dying. I think the only other dream that I've had is starting up a dance studio and having my own small business, because I see a lot of problems in the dance world with regard to body image, cultural appropriation, a lack of knowledgeable teachers. By knowledgeable, I mean teachers who know how to teach, teachers who are compassionate — I see a lack of that. I see an emphasis on competitiveness. This sort of capitalist mindset of America, it's creeping into dance more and more, and I would like to preserve dance as an art and not a competitive thing. So that's kind of my other dream, to have a healthy dance studio where people can develop as people and artists, instead of developing their egos.

            Response #8: I'd say that I'd be living in an apartment or a house, and if it's an apartment, I'd live in a big city because that's always kind of been a dream of mine. Maybe married, but I don't know yet, because I just don't know what to feel about marriage. In terms of my career, I'd say I'd either be going into law school or graduate school or publishing a book. I really, really want to do that. That's been a childhood dream since I can remember. On a tangent, I've been dancing for a long time, and I'd say figuring out my relationship to dance has always been one of the less predictable and more volatile parts of my life. In 20 years, if I can have a comfortable relationship with dance, that would be really nice too. If you don't dance for a while, it's really obvious when you become out of shape, like when your technique starts lagging, and it's really hard not to beat yourself up for that, just because the mindset ballet cultivates is perfectionism. Always having to look at yourself in the mirror, self-scrutiny, and this heightened emphasis on competition. If I can find a way to navigate that relationship in a more healthy manner, because I don't think I've really found that balance yet, that'd be nice.

I'd be living in some sort of apartment — it wouldn't be a huge apartment or anything — but I think probably an apartment in a nice part of town that's pretty modern, and where I can send my kids to a good school district for a good education and a lot of opportunities. And at the same time, there are a lot of opportunities for me to advance other parts of myself that maybe aren't fully actualized. I see myself doing yoga for some reason. I had this weird epiphany during high school, when we were doing yoga in class, and I remember thinking, this is what I think I'll be like 20 years in the future. On my day off work, I would go to a yoga studio to unwind in the middle of New York or something.

            Response #14: 20 years from now, I would really hope to find a good job. I really want to work in pediatric medicine, neonatology, because I really like babies. I'm super family oriented, so I'd want to find someplace that is close to home so I could work in a hospital nearby. I want to stay in the Bay Area, but I'd want to live in a hotter area. I really want my own family. I think I'll just be gauging the time I spend between work and family, because I think I'd have my own kids by then, but it'd be hard transitioning because the medical field does require a lot of time at the hospital. A good job is like my dad's — he has a great job where he's a biostatistician, and he had two days off from work, when he just gets to spend time with family, and he just calls in to work all the time. That has always been my definition of a good world life balance, where you aren't a workaholic taking your work home with you, kind of like my mom. It's like seeing two extreme sides of it in my family. And so I think I want to be in the middle, where I work hard enough to be able to find a steady paying job to support my family, but also have the time and the ability to go home and spend time with my family, or just have some time to spend for myself.

            Response #1: Her dad and I have always told her that career and family are both important in a person's life. Of course, after many women reach a certain age and have kids, they might not work anymore. This is something we witness a lot, putting focus on the family. Based on my daughter's personality, she probably won't do this, similarly to me as her mom. I'm pretty sure she'll always pursue her own career. But I always tell her that, as a woman, simultaneously having to keep up with your career pursuits and take care of your family is a really hard thing. Her dad and I also tell her — and this sounds a little funny, she thinks we're a little funny — to live as close to us as possible. 20 years later, she'll be at a stage where her career and family are both very busy. We'll both be retired. We'll both be able to help her, so she can have a better balance between work and family.
            <br>Her specific career, income, and field at that point we've not really thought about. We think there are too many possibilities; we don't say that certain things are better, and we don't even have preferences. We think it's hard to think of right now, and we're too lazy to think about it too. I shouldn't influence her too much, but I hope that no matter what she does, she'll also have a pretty good family life. Because I myself have a PhD, she has always thought she had to get a PhD too. She says, "I can't be less accomplished than my mom." But I tell her she doesn't have to have a PhD. I see lots of people without PhDs who are equally successful in their career developments. Even being a technical worker in a company, some become fellows without a PhD. So this is just to say, her thought process should be more open, and she doesn't need to just do research and get a PhD. She can also be an entrepreneur; she can also get a master's and then go be an engineer; she can also go to law school and be a lawyer, or go to business school, for example, to become a project manager or something like that. She has to explore. Of course, she already has a career she's interested in; she participated in science research in the past and wants to continue doing that. She also hopes to enter the school of science at her college and pursue research there, especially about things pertaining to physics and the environment. I do support her; I think I have no reason not to support her. If she's willing, it's worth a try. I always think that kids of this age are less able to be influenced by parents compared to friends or professors, right?

That would be good, but it depends on what she feels like. I cannot force her to do that. I hope that in 20 years, her work and life are more balanced.
            <br>In terms of her personality, I think she will be more assertive. She's a little different from most of the kids you interview, because she spent a lot of time in Asia, so there was a lot of authoritarian influence in her growing up, so she will be a little more reserved than normal kids. I hope that through the American education system and real life work experiences, she will be more assertive, and she can speak her own mind.
            <br>She has a very very good trait: she knows everything. You can't hide anything from her. She is a really good observer; she knows everything, but she probably doesn't say it. Now, after going to high school here, she has already opened up a lot. In 20 years, I trust there will be no problem for her to speak her own mind. Especially in the US, everybody is rather open. So for this child, I think her studying psychology is a very good match, because she's a very good listener.

            Response #3: I think he might take two extremes. He's had OCD since he was young. I think that according to his character, to some extent he might accomplish some of his big dreams, but it's also possible that he will live his own very isolated, closed-off life. Regardless of which he chooses, his choice will definitely have a reason. I can't really think of many intermediate paths. He doesn't seem to have a go-with-the-flow attitude. Something I have a hard time imagining is a steady job, a 9 to 5. I don't know why there's just not this kind of vision in my mind. If you ask me for specifics, I really have a hard time imagining. I just think his life will be more about big rises and big falls.
            When he's facing frustrations while maturing, if he comes to me to talk about it, I will still tell him the same words, "Life is a journey. It actually doesn't matter. Someday we will all leave this world. Sometimes, you'll actually find that different experiences make life more interesting. It's just that while we're going through the experiences, it's so painful. It's so painful." This might be very hard to understand for young people, but after you experience a whole life, you come to a different understanding of this. I hope that in 20 years, he's still living well, he can still honestly face himself, be self-reliant, can love his younger sister. At that point I don't know if I'll still be in the world. As one of my last wishes for him, I don't actually hope they spend their whole lives bound together, but I do hope that when they need to, they can be by each other's sides.

He will still be a very active person, I believe, and he will likely pick up other, more realistic hobbies. Dancing might not be so realistic, but maybe teaching dance. He likes to help people and he has quite some knowledge about physical therapy, so he might be very engaged in communities and helping friends and people with whatever skills he has. He was going to pursue a degree in physical therapy, so that's a possibility, but he's also very politically active, so he might be working in public office. I am not sure. And maybe cooking.

I hope in 20 years, he will be able to take all the responsibility he's supposed to take as a husband and as a father, to be a person who can stand by himself and raise the kids and support his family. What maturity means to me is to be more responsible, accountable, considerate, caring, and grounded. That's unlike now, where he has a lot of dreams, and I feel kind of like he's floating in the air. If you are still like that in 20 years, then that is not mature. I think if he finds that his passion is what he has now, I would expect he'll be doing diplomacy, like international relations, and he will be either working in the US Government or the United Nations. I know he has a lot of passion for that right now. If he changes, he would be working in industry, in big companies.

            Response #7: In twenty years, she should be over 30, so the first thing is to go to work, do what she likes to do, and then have a decent income, and then start a family, just like us, and then have kids. By the time she's 30 years old, her career should have some success, and she should no longer have to work hard for the salary, but rather do what she enjoys. In the foreseeable future, she wants to do business. I actually don't have much understanding of this field, so I let her just explore by herself. Starting a family and establishing a career are very important facets of life, but nowadays a lot of young people don't view it with importance. I do hope my children have normal families, and normally enjoy their lives, enjoy the choices brought by their hard work. I hope she has her own small family, and she and her spouse mutually love each other and have at least two kids, two to four kids.

            Response #8: I think there's no point in imagining, because I think you all are filled with lots of possibilities, I rarely bother to think about this. In 20 more years, he should be at a place where he is a respected, well-advanced person in his field. Of course, you'll need a good opportunity and a very strong character to achieve that, but you should be able to attain that if you don't mess up. So that's why I say, some things that are important are your mental health, your physical health, and also your morals — being responsible to the people around you, to society. If these things are in place, then the opportunities you want to have should lead you into becoming a person with some accomplishments, as well as some contributions.
            <br>I think that foremost, a person should have love: loving your family, loving the people around you, even having a kind of sympathy for animals, because it's basically being sensitive to the needs of others. I think this is very important. Another thing is discipline. Some people say if you don't have discipline, if you don't have a strong will, you cannot achieve what you want, even if you're trying to help other people. If you don't have discipline, you cannot even take good care of yourself. I think today's society has some very challenging things, so many distractions. Freedom is good, but if it's just freedom without structure, then you get confused.

            Response #11: According to my understanding of her, she will have two little kids, and she'll spend a lot of her energy on her family. I think that however large her career achievements are, they aren't important to her or to me. She's not a career-minded person, but that's totally fine with me. I think she'll still be a rather calm person, who won't have a lot of drama and also won't surprise me too much. She will live a very ordinary but rather relaxed life. There are a lot of things you can't predict in life, but I think she will be stable and steady, without many large ups and downs.
            She has been a relatively laid-back person since she was a child. A lot of Chinese parents might think this is bad, but to me, I think it's very good, because I think that, especially as a woman, if you have very high expectations for yourself, if you have career accomplishments, the pressure will be heavy. A lot of physical discomfort is caused by stress. Of course, it should not be too laid back. It's just to say that women need to know what they want, and they need to know to set up a boundary, know what is against their principles, and very firmly stop it. I think that children who grew up in the United States have a completely different background from those of us who grew up in China. We didn't learn to set boundaries, but now you know how to set boundaries, and there's a lot of information to teach you. I think my daughter is an independent person; she can't have codependency. No matter what happens with her future spouse, she can pick herself up and be on her own. I have confidence in her for this. Right now, her relationship with her boyfriend is quite stable. Honestly, I think they might walk the same path. That boy is also a rather quiet, rather responsible, rather calm person, so I think that together, they'll be a normal, typical middle-class family, with two kids and a steady income. They won't have major extravagances, but from the bits and pieces of their life, they have their own happiness. I think that boy is also a very pragmatic person. He knows to be frugal and not spend money arbitrarily, and he also doesn't have a lot of friends out there. She's someone who likes to socialize, but actually in the past two or three years, I was very surprised by her change.
            <br>With the situation in our family, after her dad and I split up, I was very worried that she was heavily influenced, because she was one of the main reasons for our separation. I'm scared that she feels guilty, and she's also told me before that she doesn't believe in love, doesn't believe in marriage, doesn't want kids. In her first few years of high school, she was a bit wild. She often went to join parties, and then later she would tell me lots of details. This was a wild time, but ever since she was together with this boyfriend, I think she underwent a really big change. It just made her very calm, and then she has an image of a traditional life structure. She told me she wants to get engaged at 24 or 25, and at 27 she wants to get married, and then have two kids at around 30. This is her plan right now. I think that's perfect. I never wanted her to stand out, Chinese parents all want their own kids to stand out — that's very normal, understandable, but to me, my goal is for her to be happy and healthy.

            Response #2: Throughout high school, I did research in kind of a unique field: earth science or climate science. I was really interested in things like climate or environmental science and meteorology when I was competing in the Science Olympiad, which was how I got into science. I especially got into remote sensing, which relates to space and satellite stuff. Actually, last summer, I got this internship that was really cool, and we visited the space center. My dream self would be working at NASA or being able to continue research, but I didn't say that was my most realistic, because I think that for me, that might not be as stable. Stability is definitely important and doing something like law, although it's hard, would be a little bit more stable in terms of income and stuff. But I definitely think being able to continue doing science research and work towards stuff like climate science would be really cool.

I'd love to be like, you know, in a CEO position, where other people really rely on me and I provide support and motivation for other people. One of my dreams is to be at the top of the entrepreneurial spectrum and be able to make money and really put myself out there and put my product out there. Ideally, I'd have a product that is, you know, great.

            Response #8: What I ultimately want is to be somebody making decisions in the California state government  — which obviously is not going to happen in the next five years, but being an assembly member, being an elected official that makes decisions about policy in the state and onboarding progressives into that area, that's ideal. Another ideal thing is being in Washington as an elected official, as a representative of California, and having other people – I honestly don't care if they're conservative or liberal —who are not against change in Congress. I want more young people in Congress, more people who care about their communities at home. I don't think I want influence on other people, just on the decision-making process. I don't want to be a spokesperson or anything.

I'd also say that for sure, I'm going into graduate school, too, because I love research in international relations.

            Response #10: Grad school is definitely a possibility. Hopefully I really, really, really figure out what I want to do in college. Recently, I've been leaning towards medical school, actually, which is kind of hard to do. So I see myself swamped under a lot of MCAT testing and stuff like that. I don't think of myself as a super happy person four to five years in the future. Things don't always work out.
            I actually wrote a letter to myself four years in the future. It's scheduled for 2024. It says, "I'll be proud of you if you develop a sense of style and feel okay about your clothes and your body, and have an actual educated opinion on politics, and have a good set of friends that you're able to be comfortable with, and be able to write a senior thesis or an actual paper that's not terrible, and have some sort of part time job in college. I'll be proud if you have a better relationship with your parents and not go to some town in the Midwest -- go to an East Coast city or the Bay Area or Chicago only. Overthink things a little bit less and find out what you really, really, really want to do."

            Response #11: One of the topics I'm also really interested in is history. I want to study history in college in some form, even if I don't major in it, just so I can learn more. One of the things I’ve always wanted to do is just have a published paper in history, in a journal or something like that. I read a lot about World War II, and I spend a lot of time doing research on stuff like looking at wartime documents. It's sort of a side hobby for me. I want to have some published research because it's just a lot of information sitting in my head, and I don't know what to do with it. One of the other things I want to do — one of my dream jobs is to work for the World Bank. That's why I'm studying economics and international relations. It's really competitive, but if I could land a job or an internship there, that would be very ideal. It combines three of my interests: first, it's international relations and stuff like that, second, I have a subscription to a foreign policy magazine and it's another thing I'm interested in, and third is economics. I feel like the World Bank sort of encapsulates all of these things.

            Response #12: How crazy would it be if I just moved away from everything, went to Iceland, and then herded sheep for the rest of my life, and just not have to care about all the things that I care about right now? When I went to visit Iceland last year, I was like, "How nice to just live here. You don't have to talk to anybody." I might go crazy and I might be sad because I don't have anyone to communicate with, but it just seems so peaceful and so distant from the rest of the world. I think that's my favorite place I've ever been. A fun fact is that there's more sheep than people. We would drive the whole day and barely see anybody, and we'd have to stock up on salami and crackers at grocery stores, because there were no restaurants anywhere. I imagine just being super outdoorsy and not having to deal with tourists and tour buses everywhere. Iceland was not touristy. I'm not talking about the big cities and basic spots, but the waterfalls and the landscapes just felt so untouched by civilization. It was really nice.

I feel like I do want to make some sort of lasting change in the world. That's really vague, but in terms of my career and what I do in life, I don't want it just to be for myself or my own personal gain. I want the work that I do to have a significant impact, whether that be like Doctors Without Borders or some nonprofit organizations. I think because I'm pretty focused on establishing a career and being financially independent, it'll be kind of hard for me to work nonprofit and do that kind of stuff, but if I could dream bigger, I would want to use the skills I learned in school to bring good to the world.

            Response #17: Ideally in 4 to 5 years, I would have a bachelor's degree, but maybe I get to college and figure out that I have a knack for storytelling or movies or something and I suddenly decide to go that direction. In four years, I may or may not have a bachelor's degree, but I may have already made something that attracted industry interest, and everything just starts taking off from there. When I was younger, and still to a certain degree, I really liked history. Recently I've thought about it more, and I think it may not be anything specific about history, but I think it might just be about thinking about stories in general, whether nonfiction or fiction. I remember back in elementary school, I always just liked nonfiction. I always went to those big picture books and looked at all the pictures and diagrams, and it was really fun. I didn't really like a lot of fiction, but now I have read a lot more fiction and explored a lot more literature, and I feel like there is something attractive about the way stories are created, both real ones and fictional ones. I really like thinking about the way people express an idea or a feeling that is not directly expressible, so if I could do something related to thinking about the way stories work, then that would be ideal, but it's a little too vague for me to say that that this is something I'll realistically be able to do.
            <br>I'm thinking about going into public administration or public policy right now. It was actually kind of a recent decision because I’ve liked public transportation systems since I was young. I lived in China for a couple of years with my grandparents, and I really liked riding on the buses everywhere because you could go anywhere, and it was also a lot of fun looking at all the buses with different routes going from different places towards different places. I just really enjoyed that feeling of being within this network of people traveling everywhere. So recently I thought, "Hey, maybe I could do something like that." So I'm probably going into public policy administration, maybe urban planning with a focus on transportation, but I still need to think about it.

            Response #18: I would love to be an AP US History or AP Literature teacher, or anything like that. Teachers have made such a profound impact on what I'm interested in and have completely shaped my career paths and everything, honestly more than my family has. For that reason, that is something ideal in my head, but I think the reason why I don't pursue it is because it's something that's not normalized within at least my family, and I think in most Asian or Eastern cultures. That’s because it's not seen as a very important job or high paying job — which sucks — and so I kind of buy into that, even though I don't want to. As for other wild dreams out there, I would love to go to Mars. That sounds really dumb, but I have a mild passion for space and space exploration, and I think being a pioneer on a new planet sounds like something that is very adventurous and up my alley. But that’s definitely the most unrealistic that it could get.

If after five years she still hasn't figured out what she wants to do, then things will be complicated. After two years she'll have at least decided on a major. Of course, I also hear that some people still haven't sorted this out and change majors by their third year of college. I hope she won't be like this. After graduating from college, she should be very clear on what she wants to do with her next steps, regardless of whether it's working or attending graduate school, or attending whatever kind of professional institution. She should be filled with confidence about the direction she's heading in. This is the ideal situation that I want for her.

            Response #2: She'll have a good job to support herself — that's goal number one.  With all those years of education, you need to show you can support yourself, and I think she should be able to. In the 21st century, you probably won't stay with one career for your whole life; you'll probably have at least 2-3 careers. Even myself, I've had 3 already. You'll have your main career, and you'll have a gig economy career.
            <br>Second, I hope for her to have a steady boyfriend, and have some hobbies besides work. I really want her to have some hobbies – maybe she loves to draw, and she likes to make some beautiful things — she can pick up some of those things and then sell them online and have people appreciate the stuff she's working on. It's also part of a balance of life; you can't always work. You can't just go to your boyfriend after work; you need to have something for yourself. We are too focused on career, raising a family, and we don't have much time for ourselves. My generation picked up hobbies only after retirement, which I think is kind of late. It's never too late, but if you have some kind of hobby when you're young, then you can cherish it and develop it, and maybe it can become part of your career as well. The best career is where you really love something and you can make money from it, but not everyone is that lucky.

            Response #3: I hope he can have a deeper and better understanding of, and a plan for financial independence. A person can spend a whole life changing and exploring their academics and career; you don't have to decide at 22 what you want to spend the rest of your life doing. But there are some things that are never too early to start, and never too old to think about: money can't accomplish everything, but nothing can be accomplished without money. People can't be controlled by money, but people need to have a lot of ability to create wealth. Maybe it's because I work in the financial field that I often tell this to him and his sister. Starting from high school, our family's method of teaching was to have him calculate his own allowance. He would tell me, "For this month, I need this much as my allowance." We also have clear boundaries about what this money covers. Any education expenses don't have to be covered by this money. It is all for his pleasure spending — for example, the kinds of clothes and shoes he wants to buy, the money he needs to hang out with friends. He needs a budget and a plan. I can see he has managed very well during these four years, so every month I just auto-deposit for him. I don't monitor what he does with that money. If he wants to buy marijuana, it's his money. I tell him he should start to invest early. I think he should start to learn about the market. Everything that happens in our lives financially, he needs to learn about it. I think this will give him a lot of freedom. In his upcoming life, he can make a choice with confidence. A lot of our choices have limitations because they are tied to our survival needs, but if he starts planning at this age and persists until he's 40 years old, I trust that he will already be accumulating a financial foundation, enough to let him have confidence and accomplish the life he wants to live. I also tell him, if there's a day he feels at ease financially and really wants to go back to college to do research or go be a teacher, some kind of ideal job that doesn't have a high salary, that's no problem. But as a precondition, first he needs to guarantee that he can cover his living expenses. I often share things like this with him, and he is also teaching me.
            <br>I think we as parents need to know how to let go of this authority. Other than this, I would not do anything to interfere with my children. I think he might not have left the college campus in five years; I think he will continue and go get a master's degree. He might also go into industry. He is cautious in some ways, but I think he has an eye for wealth. He might not have the kind of courage to do so, but I think he has the kind of smart vision to go search for the right people to do some interesting things with him.

I think it is very rare and valuable for him to have these kinds of thoughts at such a young age, so I will support him in pursuing his dreams. Sometimes parents will say this is too lofty, but I think it's not easy for a child to have these thoughts. I am very proud.
            <br>Of course, he has a lot of other thoughts. He says sometimes there is still some discrimination against Asians in America. He will also put in his effort in this direction. I think for a child who has just graduated from high school, these thoughts are very valuable.

            Response #5: Whatever makes him happy, I'm good with that. He's a kind-hearted and pretty happy person. To me, that's enough. He's a very social person. People make him happy. He has great friends. When he comes home, he always goes to see his friends. He mentioned that in the future, he wants to live in community-style housing, where friends are close. So that's one thing that makes him happy: people and good friends. He also likes to be helpful. Whatever work he's going to be doing, it'll be helpful for people. When he was younger, he really wanted to be a doctor, because as a doctor, you can give people a lot of help. And then he started dancing. A dance career is quite unknown, so he was going to also do physical therapy to help other dancers, or whoever has physical pain. And now, he's like, "Oh, the environment is so bad. The political environment is so bad. I want to be making public policy that will be helpful for people who suffer social injustice." So he's just there, helpful for people in general, and especially aiding people who don't have as much help in their lives.

            Response #6: I think the ideal situation is that he will have graduated, he finds a job he likes, and also he can make a reasonable amount of money to start a pretty independent career. I always think, if he's happy, I will be happy. The ideal situation is that he's doing something he likes, he's passionate about, he enjoys, and at the same time he will be rewarded so that he doesn't have to worry about the money. I'm sure he will put lots of energy and effort in it. I know he's that kind of person. When he's doing something he likes, he really puts all his time in it. I want to see that, and I believe when he's doing that, he will be successful.

First, she has to learn to be independent, and then she can give back to society.

            Response #8: As parents, we ourselves didn't grow up in America. Our parents grew up in China, we grew up in China, and then we immigrated here, but our children grew up within an American cultural environment. There are challenging and painful parts, such as when we believe that some things might actually be right but discover that our children aren't willing to accept them. They think, "You shouldn't guide me, I want to search for myself." As parents, we can't not accept it because our children are in the larger cultural environment of America here. So that makes me wonder what the ideal really is. If we as parents want certain things, how meaningful is it to our children? I can only say that I would personally feel very satisfied if my child is in a certain state in the future – which to me is that he's very hardworking, and very self-motivated, very disciplined, and has a goal. It doesn't matter what that goal is. In Silicon Valley, most people want to be an entrepreneur, but even if he says, "No, no I don't want to follow that. I want to be a musician," I would still be very happy about that, as long as he has a clear goal he is working on and not just dreaming of. You can have a nice job with a high salary, and the people around think you're doing so well and even feel jealous of you — but if you don't have a clear goal, I actually don't think that's an ideal situation. I personally believe he is a very competent child, but I think he's not very driven to go toward a goal. I don't want to tell him this, though, only for him to misunderstand it and think, "I cannot make my mom happy. I even got into an elite college and still can't make her happy." Even if he didn't get into an elite college, he can still make me happy, and it's really not about me being happy or unhappy.
            <br>There are some things related to this that I want to point out to make life better for him. For example, he always likes to play and stream video games, and the online streaming community makes him happy. I believe that from a long-term perspective, it's good if he streams something with a theme that overlaps with what he wants to do in the future, but he's not a serious gamer and he won't go very far with these games. He'll spend a lot of time streaming each week, and I really oppose this, but it's his life, his decision.
            <br>He says he has ADHD, so it's very hard for him to settle down. I accept this. I think I myself have ADHD, but my experience is not that you take Adderall and things are great; I think it's something you have to adjust yourself mentally. If it were my approach, I believe you shouldn't just take medication, but instead you should be willing to see a counselor, or do some meditation, or do some more exercise, make yourself more disciplined, and find a way to follow a certain routine. These are my thoughts, but I think he just cannot, isn't willing to accept this.

            Response #9: This ideal doesn't seem like something I need to project for her; it's something she herself imagines. In my thinking, it's actually not very important that she goes to a brand name school, because if she pursues her major until graduate school, school ranking just isn't something a typical person outside academia can understand. If, in the near future, she can get into a public school, or the tuition office of a school gives her some financial assistance, I hope the financial burden she places on herself is a little lighter. I have said to her, "If you go to graduate school, then we will no longer pay." The ideal situation is that her financial burden can be rather light when she pursues graduate school.

            Response #10: I hope they can overcome difficulties, especially right now as they are facing COVID-19. They have very limited interaction with teachers, which is a little bit difficult. On the other hand, we want them to be able to adjust to whatever situations, because we never know what is going to happen in the future. We want them to learn as much as they can, and also find different ways to prepare themselves, so no matter what may be happening, they can study harder, read more books, ask more questions, and interact with the professors when they need help online. I think sometimes they will connect with friends as well, and they support each other and learn from each other. As parents, we will always be there to help them when they need. We guide them, and hopefully they can be independent as well.

            Response #11: I think the best situation is where she does what she enjoys and is passionate about. Right now, she's very into skincare products. I think that for girls, this is very good. I don't know whether it will last, but I have discussed with her, "You've studied so many skincare products, why don't you open a YouTube channel? You can teach people how to do that." But with her personality, I also don't push her. I just wanted to give her an idea. In the future, if she still enjoys skincare and gains a deeper understanding of it for people of different age levels and such, I tell her, "You can try to find a job in skincare product companies, or later on, if you do really well, maybe you can open your own skincare product." I still can't confirm whether skincare is just a hobby brought on by her age — I think that overall, she is a rather laid-back person — but girls all enjoy being pretty.  I don't know what things will be like in a few years. I don't think she has a big goal. I think she will at first do an office job, and I think she should experience an office job, because working out there isn't that easy: relations with the boss, relations with coworkers. With these things on top of the job, it's even harder.

I know that doesn't correlate with happiness, or in some cases there's a negative correlation, but I don't know – as a just-graduated high schooler, I still kind of romanticize those things. I would still want to connect with my friends and be able to find new ones that I'm able to connect with. I want to have time on the weekends to spend with kids or do interesting activities, whether it be an extracurricular or just hanging out with friends.

Ideally, I can teach them some of the values I hold important and, you know, help them find their own values in life too. The first value that’s important to me is dedication, whether that’s to family or to your work. I think it’s important to be hard-working and chase after your dreams relentlessly. That’s definitely a value I'd teach them. Number two is like integrity in basically anything. Staying true to yourself—that kind of thing.

Just Asian-American: rising Asian American actresses and actors, Asian-American composers, directors, and crew. Just really really getting that representation out there. I'd say that's such a far-fetched dream, but I'd say that's definitely something I'd love to happen in 20 years. Becoming a professor is another dream of mine. I want to travel as a professor, visit all these cool places, do research and get to know the people who make up each culture. So, I guess being a professor at Stanford is also the dream. I just love this school and all the connections and relationships that professors form with their students. If I could be a part of that, that’d be really nice.

Sometimes, I just think about how different life would be if I lived somewhere else, where we wouldn’t have the same pressures and worries that we do here. Especially in the Bay Area, all the academic pressure put on kids can be really damaging to mental health. The rigor is sometimes good for teaching how to work hard and be successful, but it can also be too much. It’s a balance of wanting to push your kids–but not too hard. But if you moved to a random place in the middle of nowhere, you could have a lake and not have to stress every single day.

Ideally, I’ll be able to give back to my parents in money, because I feel like they sacrificed a lot in terms of immigrating here. They don’t spend a lot of money, so I think in 40 years—if they’re still hopefully here—I’ll be able to support them as much as I can.

            Response #12: 20 years down the line, I’ll hopefully be moving up a few tiers in the healthcare field. After my nursing degree, I may go back to school and get a Master’s degree in something and just keep learning. Ideally, you know, I’ll find a comfortable place to live with my family of four and just live comfortably. I don't really know what else I would want besides financial freedom. I just want the happiness that comes along with simply being able to enjoy the presence of the people around you without having to worry about paying something off. And I definitely want to have time for my hobbies. I've been thinking about starting a blog on the side and, you know, 20 years down the line, I can definitely see that as a possibility if I have the right resources. Maybe I’ll get a team together to make a blog about something I'm passionate about. Some of my hobbies include exercise and fitness, so something along the lines of health and well-being.

Also, my family's kind of against this with everything that's going on between Hong Kong and China, but my parents immigrated from there, and I’d want to go back and see.

I just want to be a more mentally strong person too, so I think that's what I'll be working towards. Hopefully I’ll be better by then. I think I would also like to find an academic passion and focus on that to become more knowledgeable in it. But, I think I would rather have more emotional intelligence than be more book smart. I want to be able to listen to other people's stories and just—I don't know—become more wise from that. Listening to other people talk about their lives is always really interesting.

            Response #3: I have a hard time imagining what his companion will be like, but I hope he has a healthy relationship. My definition of a healthy relationship is very vast. I can accept any kind of relationship, as long as he is serious and felicitous. A healthy relationship means respecting and being respected. It is an understanding, loving, and not abusive relationship. It will bring you joy, but you're not locked in. Any type of relationship will have a painful part, but I think painful and harmful are two different things. Sometimes only in pain can you understand the other person. But as for harm, I don't hope that anyone -- whether it's in the flesh or in the mind -- devastates the other person. I hope the other person is someone he truly loves in his heart, and the other person truly loves him in their heart, too. It's not necessarily about how long they're together, or how well-matched they are, as long as that person allows him, during that period of time, to have a worthwhile journey. Maybe my concept of a positive relationship is different from a lot of traditional Asian parents. It's pretty different compared to that of my ancestors.

There is a chance he will go back to China, but that depends on the global situation. China is developing faster and faster, and I see it in a good light. As for the little things, I still hope he can see family as pretty important, whether it's his parents or his brothers. In Chinese tradition, we are all one big family. We are all very close. I hope that 20 years later, we are all still very close. Despite them growing up in the US, I hope my children don't lose Chinese culture.

She can choose to do what she wants and have more time to interact with her kids. I hope she has some investments, so even if she doesn't have a husband, she can have a rental property and use the rental income. I hope both she and her partner can be financially free and travel the world by age 40. She needs to be very money-conscious, invest, and have a financial plan for herself. Looking back at my own process of growing up, I actually didn't understand a lot of this, but now I understand that there are a lot of opportunities along your path that you can grab. At this age, she just sees her ideal situation, her family, her boyfriend — but she doesn't think about these detailed things.

            Response #2: Career-wise, I'm pretty worried about being pushed to do something that I don't really like to do. For example, there are all these tech companies around us; I think there's definitely going to be a pressure for me to do CS and go join one of the tech companies. That's totally cool because it's very stable, and I know a lot of my peers are probably going to be doing that or some entrepreneurial stuff. My interests are kind of unique in that I want to do science research or law. In the end, I just want to be pursuing something that I enjoy, which could also change. I don't want to be pushed into doing what other people are doing and end up not enjoying that – that's a big fear I have in terms of career.
            <br>I'm definitely also worried about being able to maintain a balance between pursuing a career I want and maintaining close relationships. In high school, for example, I spent a long time on clubs — I did marching band and research and science lab and all that — and it decreased the amount of time to spend with friends. The same thing happened to a lot of my friends, too, and we've kind of split apart. I don't want that to happen by the end of university. I don't want to split off from my parents and my sister, either.

Another fear that I have is sacrificing too much or not doing the right thing. Something akin to what I did in high school is not dedicating enough time to my personal well-being or hanging out with others. On the other side of the spectrum, I fear not dedicating enough time to my work — not actually working hard during college and not learning enough material to be prepared for the future, not making sufficient connections with people so that I can get an occupation after college.

            Response #6: I think I most fear being a person who's unable to make time for their parents in their life. I don't want to be someone who's so focused on a career and what I want in life that I totally neglect the family that I have right now. Even if I'm trying to find a partner for myself, I definitely think the family I currently have comes before that. Additionally, I hope I'm super rich one day, but I don't want to be a person who flaunts their richness. Right now, I live a pretty simple, pretty humble life with simple stuff, simple foods, simple clothes, simple house. I definitely want to continue that lifestyle. I don't want to be someone who takes their money and other people's acknowledgement of them for granted. Another fear is not being able to graduate college or not being able to find a job. Those are fears, but they're definitely lesser for me, because my philosophy is that I'm going to go wherever life takes me, so I have trust and faith that I'm probably going to find some way to get out of it.

            Response #7: I am a pretty optimistic and happy person, so it's hard for me to think of fears. It doesn't mean I can't; I just don't think about it often. I think I have a fear that I don't understand the political process well enough currently to have influence on it. I have this dream where I graduate from Stanford, and I have more influence and I can go and do the job that I want, and that job can have more impact, but I tend to forget that a lot of these systems are much bigger than ourselves. I like to think that the state assembly member has as much power as the president of the US or the governor to single-handedly change things. And honestly, in California, that works pretty well, but my fear is that I'll just be like a small person in the whole system, analyzing policy or something instead of actually participating in the decision-making process.

            Response #8: Seeing how the job market is tanking right now, I’m afraid it won't recover in four or five years, especially for humanities majors, and I'm scared that I'm going to be living paycheck to paycheck doing weird jobs or freelance writing or something, without stable housing. Having no direction is very possible for anyone, but especially for a humanities major. I've lived a pretty sheltered and privileged life, so I wouldn't really know what to do with myself in that case, because I feel like I would really be hard on myself and my mental health would go downhill.

            Response #9: In 4 to 5 years, I'm scared of feeling the same way I do now, because I feel I'm currently not a very confident person in my abilities or my personality or anything, really. If I still feel scared of what people think of me 4 to 5 years later, that would be kind of disappointing. I think what I'm really scared of is just staying the same as what I am right now. I always want to be feeling better and more successful. If I still don't know what I want to do 4 to 5 years later, that would not be good. That would be very bad. I want to be decided and be following a career that I actually really, really love. If I don't have clarity and confidence in my direction, that would be not great. In terms of more concrete things, if I take the MCAT, I don't want to fail. I do want to get into grad school.

            Response #12: I definitely fear not having a clear direction in my life. I'm really worried about just having graduated but being jobless and living with my parents. I think that's my biggest fear: that I'll just be kind of a failure, or if I work really hard at getting into physician assistant school and still end up not getting in. Secondary to that would be being alone and not having friends. I know it's pretty easy to make friends in college, but once you graduate, and you're in the adult world, I'm pretty worried about not really having a social circle or somewhere to find support.

            Response #14: I think like med school is always hard, no matter what, no matter how smart you are, no matter your income or status. A big fear I have is failing. Even though I know I'll work hard towards it, I fear having that regret of wondering if I wasted my parents' money. Also, right now, I have a close net of friends, and I'm usually with my boyfriend. Usually, I'm the person who is very laid back and I kind of just observe people before I make friends. Usually people come to me. I know in med school that'll change completely. I'll have to go out of my way to make friends.  I also think med school will be different just because I'm on my own and I might not be in the same state or city. Right now, during undergrad, I have people I'm close to and I feel safe, but I have a fear of going to new places and being lost, directionally and mentally. I think it's very exciting, but also very daunting because I just never know what to expect.

            Response #16: With the current economy and all that, I do worry about finding a full-time job after graduation that I'm actually passionate about. I read somewhere that people who go to more elite colleges are always the ones who are more worried about employment post grad, compared to people who go to community college. But what they're actually afraid of is not finding a job that they love and are passionate about. I think that's really true, and I'm definitely scared of that myself. It's possible that I'll be working a nine-to-five at a company that's not very well known or doesn't have a lot of cool people in it, or people that I don't look up to. Anything like that is really scary. I really want to be surrounded by mentors who will help boost my growth in whatever career I choose. It's scary to think that my whole life will just be stuck in the nine to five, always trying to get a better job, but maybe not being able to, because I started out in a worse place than I should have. Another fear is that I feel like I'm sort of like a serial dater. I worry a little bit about not having love prospects post-grad. To be in a workplace where I don't necessarily feel passionate about the company or the people, there's a possibility that I won't be able to meet my future husband at a workplace like that. College is a built-in community with everything, and it's scary to exit that and go out into the world, and have to do things for your apartment and pay rent — all that definitely is scary. I guess within four to five years, it's okay if both those fears come true, because there's always more time, but I would think if I was still struggling with the same things further down the line, then it would feel pretty shitty. I just don't want to feel like my life is being wasted away.

And also, it would be scary if I'm looking for a job, but maybe the job market becomes even worse in 4 to 5 years — I mean, who knows what the ripple effects of the pandemic will be? Airlines have been laying off people. It's really hard to say what the world will look like in 4 to 5 years, so there could be a lot of things that could go wrong, because this year, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. I just hope that this is not a continuing trend. There could be a lot of things that could go wrong, but I feel like because of my background, I should be fine either way. My parents have enough money to put me through college, and they're educated, and they prioritize my education, so I feel like I should be pretty secure. I don't have as much to worry about as a lot of my peers in this country have to worry about, so I'm pretty grateful for that.

            Response #1: I really don't have much to worry about, in all honesty. She's staying close to our family for college. I didn't intend for it to be this way. I originally encouraged her to go somewhere farther away, because I think she'll be able to immerse herself more deeply into the campus environment and experience different places' cultures. She's always been in this environment with a large Asian population. I actually hope she can go into a different kind of environment and experience different parts of American culture. However, in this year's extraordinary circumstances, I think there was no better choice than going to school close to home. It's much more convenient, and we also feel much less worried. I tell her, of course, that she doesn't have to come home: "After you go to school, you don't have to come home except when it's mandatory during winter and summer breaks. If you need anything, we can bring it to you. And try your best to experience campus life. If there's a chance to go to another state or another country to study or intern, try your best to go. I always hope she can go out and explore some different environments. I also have confidence in her because she's always set pretty strict standards for herself, and she's had her own dreams. Even though she hasn't clearly figured out what she wants to do, she still has pursuits and is always working on something. If she were younger, I might have still worried about her socializing with classmates, whether she'd be lonely, what people she'd get along with. But now I think she should be mature enough to handle these things.

            Response #2: I'm worried about these racial issues right now, including African American issues and the coronavirus hostility against Asians. Kids who grow up here, although they look Asian, are actually American in their values, their thinking process. Everything is all Americanized, but people just look at their skin color and think they're not American and treat them differently. The kids are confused, thinking "why do you treat me like this when I am American?" For example, my older daughter was in the parking lot and a person just shouted at her, "Coronavirus!" And she was shocked. That was her first experience with racism. My friends and I discuss, is America a safe environment for our kids anymore? Should we still keep all our connections in Asia? Maybe someday our kids will have to use them. There is this feeling that this country is not their country anymore, and it frightens me. I think their generation should seek more political influence. We need more people to seek public office, to just amplify our voice.

My fear is that he can spend a lot of energy when he's passionate and young, right? But he can put in all that energy and still be very disappointed, because it's just really hard to change the system. I think he's just going to be disappointed.

            Response #7: I'm most worried that her life won't have goals. There are a lot of things that schooling can teach you, but for work and life, you need IQ and EQ. I don't want the school she attends to be the peak of her life. She will complete a pretty good education and rise to a certain level, but I hope she'll always work hard to go further, mountain after mountain, rather than sliding down. What really affects your entire life are not your academic grades, but these work skills, social skills, and what's called grit — your ability to sort things out when you run into difficulties. Learning in school is passive, but in life, a lot of things are proactive. I tell her, "You have to exercise. You have to receive new knowledge. No one will force you to do these things. If you just come home and sleep after class, then your life is without proactiveness." There are many successful people in society. I hope she can learn the successful qualities of others, and turn them into her own successful qualities, and then constantly let herself grow and become more perfect.

            Response #8: I think he's a very good child, so I'm not worried about him creating any trouble. What I'm more worried about is whether or not he'll feel stressed out, because a lot of the time, if you don't face certain problems, those problems will follow you, oppress you. I think time management, paying attention to your own health condition, resting — these things have become extremely important to your generation. Otherwise, with a very competitive career, so many distractions, and social media, you can basically spin around 24 hours nonstop. Eventually this will add a lot of stress to your physical body and mental health. I think this maturity is important, but maturity takes time. Sometimes as a parent, it seems like I don't have any good ideas to help my child, so I can only go pray for it. Just like when we were young before, when you cannot see something, you simply cannot see it. I had a realization: where our generation suffered, where we experienced bitterness, there's actually a positive side, which is that we didn't have many distractions; we only had television when we were a little older. In contrast, we had a lot of idle time to dream, to just work and play. Compared to the younger generation, we are more able to resist distraction. We are less prone to pleasure-seeking and avoiding pain, because we had to eat a lot of bitterness since we were young. If he is not naturally the calm, steady type, the challenge might be slightly bigger for his generation. The internet basically just got made in the 90s, so it's very hard for his generation to see a life without it.

            Response #10: I worry about the stress. The health science field or medical field will have some risk, especially nowadays with the coronavirus. Also, because of the long hours, I think there will be some stress as well. I tell them to stay healthy, to make their immune system strong, try to eat some vitamins, exercise, practice deep breathing. I hope they will be able to balance their lives even though sometimes it's stressful. For emotional and psychological wellbeing, I think it's good for a person to be able to calm down and take their mind off work. I hope they know that in whatever situation, they will be fine and stay strong, and also have family support. I also hope they will be around good friends, which can relax their mind.

I think a job that doesn't give me a lot of time to spend with other people, that's very rigid, and that's about something I'm not interested in, that I don't look forward to, would demoralize me a lot. I don't want to sound generic, but I fear the traditional things that are associated with failure, like poverty. I don't mean it as an offensive term; it's just something I fear for myself. And maybe being socially outcast is another thing I fear.

I'm fearful of not being able to fulfill that responsibility. Also, as my parents get older, they're probably going to leave this world sometime. That's definitely a fear, and I think a lot of times I don't realize how much support and stability they give me. I fear not having that stability and having to find new sources of stability. I'm not saying that parents can ever be replaced, but I think finding a way to live without them is probably going to be one of the struggles for me.

I know my mom always pushes me to have kids early, so if I don't have kids by then, maybe that'll be concerning. I'm worried that I'm going to be stuck working in some very small town in the Midwest that's not very important and not very busy. There's just not as much to do, and it's not as alive. I'm the kind of person who really, really wants excitement or at least a little bit of chaos in my life. If I'm going to be somewhere small, I would at least want it to be back in California. Hopefully I stay in touch with my friends from college and high school. One thing I really worry about is if, at a high school reunion 20 years later, I don't feel like I'm more accomplished. That would not be good. If I'm really being honest, I want to be more successful than the people around me, but also just more accomplished than I am now, and more confident than I am now.

And so, I have a fear of living alone — not that it's a bad thing, but for me it's important to have something I can see as a legacy, something I can leave behind, something to support. I fear not having a family to support even if I'm financially stable, and I also fear being overstressed with my work and, worst case scenario, not liking my job. I think that'd be a terrible place to be, having to study for this thing, and maybe even going for a masters, then just not liking it when I actually finally get to become a nurse. It would be pretty sad just dreading work every day. That's a terrible reality I wouldn't want to see myself in.

            Response #15: I fear that maybe I will just not be able to think about stuff like I do now, because I've heard about how teens are naturally more empathetic. If that's the case, I just hope that I'll be able to stay empathetic, to keep some of the good parts of being a teenager, because we learned in our health class that teens' brains change and continue developing until their 20s, so there's a lot to come still. I just hope that I will still be able to keep a lot of the good parts, keep those neural connections strong so that in 10 to 20 years, I'm not just someone who only does their job. I want to be someone who can still be really empathetic, think about others and the world. That's what I'm worried about: will I just become a really boring person from my current point of view?

            Response #16: I fear that if I get too wrapped up in my career, I won't have enough time to spend with my kids, or to spend on projects that I'm passionate about, or even to read. A big fear of mine is that I won't be a good parent. I really want to be a good parent. I have a baby brother, and I sort of experiment with him, almost to see what kind of parent I will be in the future. And while I like to think I'll be a better parent than my parents, there are certain traits that we inherit, and sometimes certain characteristics are inevitable. And so I'm worried that I'll be short tempered with my kids, or that I won't have enough time for them.

            Response #1: Between having a family and the type of work she wants to do, I think it's possible that it will be impossible to avoid some struggle 20 years later. Society now is tougher and tougher, competition is stronger and stronger. I imagine that everyone does not have it easy. Especially for people like my child, her character is always striving to be on top. If she wants to do well in everything she does, then she'll probably give herself a lot of pressure. Having to give a lot for her family simultaneously, I think she'll have to "eat some bitterness." But I imagine that other people are like this too, and there's not much to be done. If nothing unexpected happens with her, and she continues to grow in the US, I don't think there will be things that I would worry about. If it were another child, it might be different, but her character is very stable; she never does anything that will cause people to be very surprised. She also isn't a very stubborn person, so I can let my heart feel safe for her.

            Response #2: In 20 years, if she finds out that whatever she studied or pursued isn't what she wants, I guess it's not too late to change her career course in midlife, but it would be hard. So that would be my worry. Also, what if her husband or boyfriend is not that decent, and she experiences some kind of domestic dispute or something? That could weigh really heavily on girls. One of my friends is undergoing divorce right now, in middle age. What do you do when you go through that with children in the house? It's all the emotional toll. That's my worry.

I hope when she looks back, she won't be regretful, and just be able to live a life she wants to live. I hope her life is quite felicitous. I believe that as long as she continues to move upwards with an enthusiastic attitude, and take care of the challenges she encounters, there's not much I really need to worry about. As long as her spirit is there, she'll be good.

            Response #8: In 20 years, if he can settle his relationships well — his relationships with himself, with society, with his family — then he can have a fulfilled life. 20 years later, if he is almost 40 years old and realizes he hasn't achieved what he wanted, he'll start to feel very frustrated. If it's just 4 or 5 years later, he might be confused or struggle, but he hasn't gotten to the point where he feels completely frustrated or bad about himself. But if he's 40 or 50 years old and hasn't found a way to settle himself, then he'll probably feel disappointed and frustrated. A person might just fall into depression like that.

She doesn't even have time to connect with her mom or with her friends. She gets laid off, her job gets replaced, and then she's very frustrated and doesn't know what next steps to take, and she is a single person at home crying. Or she gets sick, and there's no way to endure it, no way to work. It's just very lonely with nowhere to go and no way to start her career anew or start the dating process again. I worry about things like this.

            Response #10: I think, later on my children will grow their own families. Their kids will need their attention and care, so hopefully they can spend time with their kids, even though they will be busy at work. Also, because of their work environments in hospitals, I worry they will be at risk for being exposed to different viruses. Hopefully, they can take care of their own health, because they have to do that in order to take care of others, take care of family. Additionally, nowadays there are a lot of distractions by cell phones, by social media. In 20 years, there might be even more, so I think that will also take away their time or make them feel stressed. I hope that when they find a job in the future, that they will be able to manage money well, so they won't need to take out too much in loans. Homes are so expensive nowadays, so they may need loans, but I hope they can plan well, so they don't need to worry about these things later on. I think it's also good if they can save some money for their future, so that in case something happens, they still have some savings to support them.

            Response #11: I worry a little about her health. Even though we don't need medication for her condition, there will be some things that we need to monitor. The second thing is her family. Just in case there is a problem between her and her husband, or if something happens and she has to be on her own, I hope she has the financial stability and also the mental stability to stand up and move on. There isn't much to make me worried. I always tell her that we are how we respond to reality. It's not an easy process, but we can slowly have awareness and slowly control what your reality is. Instead of thinking about the worst situation foremost, rather think about what's more reasonable or better.
